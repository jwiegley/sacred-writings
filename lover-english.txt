O heart-surrended lover of the traceless Friend!

A thousand mystic knowers have wandered far in search of Him, yet all remained
bereft and were kept back from beholding his Face -- yet thou hast found Him;
thou hast recognized Him. You have won the contest through service and
established yourself thereby, raising up the standard of fortune and
well-being. What amazing news and marvelous tidings! So many, who sought yet
found nothing, whilst these others, who sought nothing, discovered all. By
God! They had longed with sated hearts, devoid of hunger; theirs was a quest
of knowers, not the love-stricken.

  The learned, who reap their harvest,
  know nothing of Laylí's secret:
  that no greater miracle exists
  than Majnún and his deep regret.

A lover in repose doth excel the deeds of those who know.

The glory of God rest upon thee.
