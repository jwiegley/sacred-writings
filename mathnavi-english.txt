He is the Most Glorious

O Life of the throne, Sun of affection,
Whose world and possibility has not birthed Your light?

Were creation not veiled from meeting,
I would utter a word or two about the secret of eternity.

So that all souls become pledged to You,
So that all hearts become madly in love with You,

To see a world crazed and intoxicated,
Souls held in both hands for sacrifice,

So that Your command may reach, O pride of time,
They cast themselves freely at Your arrival.

Raise Your head like the sun from the mountain of the soul,
So they may behold You plainly from every side.

Show forth Your face, as radiant as the moon,
With kindness, make this moment green and flourishing.

A drop seeks from Your ocean a Kawthar,
Make it a Kawthar, for You are a King greater.

An atom has become a seeker of Your light,
Grant it out of kindness, without measure and reason.

A seed has opened its mouth toward the sky,
So that bounty from Your grace may come upon it.

Shower upon us the drops of Your mercy,
O Sovereign of the throne, O Leader of the lands.

Tear away this veil of a hundred folds,
Reveal now the beauty of that countenance.

For there is no doubt in Your bounty,
Bind for us a provision from Your kindness.

Make this West now the East of all,
Give to this bitter, the joy of sweetness.

Grant light to the heart from the illumination of lights,
So they may behold from Your face the lights of Mount Sinai.

Arise, draw the sword of Godhead,
Hasten, slay these enemies of Your faith.

Kindle and blaze the fire of Your divinity,
Sweetly burn these heretics of Your war.

All are bats, O Sun of the day,
Rise and burn away all darkness.

Clarify this sorrow-soaked pain,
Give light to this depressed candle of the night.

A world stands because of You, as You in spirit,
So that Your command becomes manifest, create and split.

O Price of life, in memory of Your face,
I would speak riddles all from Your character.

To raise souls from wisdom,
To see in Your love, who is wise.

I will ignite a fire in the world,
To burn the veils of sanctity.

Raise the maiden of meaning from her veil,
Uncover the mask of a hidden light.

A mystery from the eternal secrets of love,
I will reveal as You've returned to the soul.

Come well, O bird of fire in explanation,
So that descriptions of existence remain not in-between.

Purify these hearts full of envy,
Sincere make these hearts without vigil.

So that those unconscious of Your covenant, O Generous,
May also come to consciousness from the ancient chalice.

Perhaps from the melodies of holiness, O our friend,
Remove from us both consciousness and unconsciousness.

O Seraph of Glory, O King of souls,
Offer a life to the dead.

The first Lote-Tree was from the branches of the heart,
Deliver it from air, water and clay.

Until it becomes free from essence and accident,
Until from its candle, suns become radiant.

Plant this sapling in the soil of the heart,
Then keep it sacred from light and shade.

Protect it from the varying winds,
Make it free from the delusion of the polytheist.

Establish its root firmly in the soil of the soul,
Pass its branch through the heavens.

Bring a new spring forth into view,
So that these dead may arise from your resurrection.

The boiling of the seas of love is from Your heat,
The consciousness of the birds of eternity is from Your wisdom.

The scent of the shirt brings life from the Egypt of the soul,
Show the Lote-Tree of Moses plainly here.

O Beloved, from Your countenance came spring,
From this spring came countless truths.

Every flower from it is a page of the Beloved's beauty,
Every heart from it is a Kawthar of His bounty.

No autumn comes after these springs,
All flowers are circling around its seasons.

This is not a spring that withers the soul,
This is a spring that creates souls.

That spring brought longing for beauty,
And this spring brought the love of the Divine.

That spring has annihilation in its wake,
And this spring has eternity as its title.

That spring rises from the season in the world,
And this spring arises from the light of the Beloved's face.

That spring brings forth tulips,
And this spring now holds laments.

This eternal spring from the light of the King,
Has struck its camp from the grain-pit to the divine throne.

All have entered into His encampment,
If you have eyes, look wisely.

When our King throws the veil from His face,
This spring sets up its tent in the heavens.

When our Beloved removes the mask from His face,
This spring blazes forth without a veil.

We are in His gardens in the spring,
We gaze from His face into the flower garden.

In His remembrance, we are free from the remembrance of others,
From His sun, we shine in the world.

Should a breeze stir from this sweet spring,
You would see Josephs coming into view.

Should a breeze stir from this flower garden,
You would see Josephs of the soul in the world.

You would see bodies becoming like the soul,
Every moment, the soul experiences a hundred kinds of victories.

This spring of the sacred soul has every moment,
A hundred expressions, but where is the confidant?

This expression is sacred from the tongue,
How can these unworthy ones reach its meaning?

This expression is not of words, phrases, and sounds,
This expression is of the soul, and it does not die.

You will see lovers in this spring,
Offering their souls, a hundred thousand times every moment.

This is the spring of divine majesty,
This is the season of heavenly sanctity.

If a breeze from this dawn touches you,
The soul of mortality will drink the cup of eternity.

Should a breeze reach you from the beloved's lane,
Sacrifice your soul, for this soul also belongs to Him.

See the tulip of unity in this spring,
Observe the spica of abstraction from the beloved's tresses.

Seek the buds of understanding in this place,
All of them seeking, out of longing for Him.

His cypresses, they tell of the beauty's stature,
His green grass, a book from the Friend's creator.

His nightingales, intoxicated from the cup of pre-existence,
His moons, entranced by the beauty of the beloved.

Nightingales are inebriated in the yearning for His union,
All are intoxicated by the breeze of His grace.

Should the song of this nightingale become manifest,
The soul of creation would be purified from envy.

The ocean of meaning is surging from this discourse,
The sphere of existence, churned by His generosity.

Each poppy that blooms from this spring,
Reveals a hundred truths from the beloved's mystery.

Musk's fragrance emanates from the beloved's curl,
His hand of bounty bestows upon you.

See His tress burning like a salamander,
For it turns into flame at the sight of the beloved.

The holy nightingale from the separation of the friend,
Has lamentations that burn the marrow and skin.

Should He sigh from the pain of His own separation,
It would cast a flame into the hearts of the chosen.

This portion is not for the uninitiated,
O beloved, do not withhold this bounty of grace.

Send forth from the soul divine musk,
So that these unworthy ones may catch your fragrance.

This spring of spirit is eternal,
Not a spring from which autumn follows.

From this spiritual, holy spring, the soul emerges,
And from its love, the light of Noah emerges.

It sets the people of the ark upon the sky,
And then bestows upon each a hundred kinds of realm.

O beauty of God, come forth from behind the veil,
So that the sun may rise from the west.

Unveil the essence of heavenly knowledge,
Open the treasure-house of unseen mysteries.

So that these dead may catch a scent from your musk,
And these unconscious ones may be gladdened by your wine.

Adorn this humble earth with the robe of unity,
O loving one, clothe it in the mantle of honor.

Enrobe the transient in the garment of eternity,
Quench the thirst of unfortunate poverty with the nectar of abundance.

So that He may emerge entirely from behind the veil,
Pull off the mask from the pain of possibility and existence.

He emerges intoxicated and senseless,
Like a candle encased within a lantern, returning.

When this thorn blew from your rose garden,
Let a hundred rose gardens appear from it.

Engrave the name of every rose garden,
Then grace each leaf with the imprint of your step.

So that the radiance of your countenance may become manifest,
Filling the earth and heavens with your light.

Blow a wind of mercy, O Generous One,
Tear away the veils of negligence from this infirm one.

Provide sanctuary under your Lote-Tree,
To the pure spirits, O Sultan of the Moon.

Open a door from the divine pleasure of meaning,
Do not block this gate for the love of God.

So that I may enter the world without veils,
To articulate a symbol of your benevolence.

Said God, God, oh good man,
Do not speak the symbol of truth amidst the ignorant.

God, God, O tongue of the Divine Mystery,
Speak softly and harmoniously with the people.

Perhaps your grace will take their hands,
And make them free from this fear and that.

Become a bird, unfold your wings of meaning,
Travel in the breeze of His proximity.

His nearness is not through bodily steps,
When you find Him in the soul, you arrive at the step.

With that, traverse the spheres of existence,
Nothing is challenging when you are lost in prostration.

In explaining this, I'll utter a point,
So you may take a share from the water of life.

So you become aware of the eternal divine pleasure,
So you may traverse a path within the realm of meeting.

Until you tread the path of spiritual earth,
Until your soul's flight sails in His breeze.

While you are now trapped in the snare of clay,
When will you perceive a scent from the pleasure-garden of the heart?

Therefore, strip yourself of the garment of limitations,
Sanctify your soul from boundaries.

Illuminate the darkness of the heart with His light,
So you may become a prince in the realm of souls.

When the darkness departs, His light is the dawn,
Upon your heart, the lights of His Sinai are flashing.

When your night has departed, the morning becomes apparent,
Even the zephyr of spiritual might blows.

So you, this darkness, and this ruined soul,
The water of life manifests through His Divinity.

Should you pass beyond the darkness of your own self,
Effortlessly, you would partake of the wine of life.

Enter then, into the shade of the verdant soul,
So that you may be free of this abode of darkness.

That Khidr drank and rose from death,
And this verdant one imparts a hundred founts of life.

The water of life He lavishly bestows on all,
Revealing the self as a sacrifice to the Singular King.

That Khidr strived before he arrived,
From this verdant one, a hundred springs instantly appear.

That Khidr sought after a spring,
This verdant one has springs following his course.

O Glory of the Soul, return from this hunt,
So that you may capture a hundred thousand meanings.

Leave the hunt for the dead, for the sake of the grave,
Capture instead the meaning from the wilderness of Sinai.

You have hunted the souls of lovers in the desert,
So that all souls have passed beyond existence.

There's no time to reveal the secrets of the rose
To the nightingale, O Sultan of Roses.

Set your falcon free from your wrist, O Beloved,
So that it may return with meanings from that realm.

Now, hunt the Simorgh of Meaning,
Unlock a treasure with your key.

Fulfill now the promise you have made,
O you who illuminate both earth and heaven with your light.

Make the world joyous with your Spring,
So that your Paradise becomes the envy of the Garden of Eden.

From the truths, many anemones are in bloom,
In the open air of this soul's spring garden.

Make clear the nightingale's riddle from each flower,
Expound the mystery of the heart to the sovereigns.

For here, at this time, the uninitiated is present,
The initiated and uninitiated here are as one.

O dawn breeze, from the tresses of the Beloved,
Bring the perfumed breaths of the spiritual musk.

O cloud of spiritual grace, pour forth,
So that the shell might give birth to myriad pearls.

The explanation of the esoteric truths is yet to be told,
The mention of the journey across the spiritual earth is yet to be made.

So you, intoxicated with the cup of vanity,
Transform the fire of your ego into light.

Until you traverse the world in a single breath,
Until you are freed from the imprisonment of this cage,

Before you enter the shadow of the Beloved,
You know nothing of the core, nor of the shell.

The foot of true meaning is buried in clay,
Unaware of the lights of that handsome face.

When you take refuge in the shadow of the King of souls,
Only then will you remove your heart from worldly concerns.

In the first hour, you were in the dust,
At the last hour, you will transcend the sun.

Then, suddenly, you traverse the realms of the soul,
Taking steps without moving, know this, O seeker.

Now, a scent from the rose garden of the soul wafts,
Rise and spread, making this world fragrant.

The musk of the soul again from that divine garden of bounty spreads,
Wafts and carries away all that once was.

Here, consciousness and unconsciousness have passed away,
Intoxication and sobriety have all dissolved into one.

Awake is lost, no trace of it remains,
The sober becomes intoxicated, and no trace of sobriety lingers.

All that was of the name and form of this world,
Became naught when the king was revealed.

For even if the names fly for two hundred centuries,
They can't carry a scent of His worth.

What your eyes have seen and your ears have heard,
From all of it, be pure, O Guided One.

With these eyes and ears, O sightless one,
When will you become aware of the secret of the Beloved?

Open your other eye to the new Beloved,
Uncover your other ear, then listen.

The eye of the ignorant sees but the footstep,
The eye of the wise perceives the secrets of the eternal.

The eye of the sage treads a path of hundreds of thousands of years,
The eye of the ignorant cannot perceive the countenance of the King.

A seeker asked a sage, when
Did you step upon the mysteries of God?

You, who've become intoxicated from the wine of His Grace,
Does any memory of the Day of Alast* linger with you?

He replied, the echo of that voice and speech does stir my memory,
How could it be otherwise, it was and will not be again.

In my ears, there's always His melody,
That beautiful voice that enhances the soul.

Another sage, who had trod the finer path,
Had woven himself into the mysteries of God,

He said, "That divine day never ended,
We are in that eternal day and it does not falter.

That day has no sunset, nor does night follow,
We exist in that day, and it should not seem strange.

If the taste of life's day departs from the soul,
Do you not see the throne and carpet still in place?

For that everlasting day, by His power,
Eternally manifest, emanates from His presence.

So, oh soul, lend your ear to this riddle,
Heed the counsel of divine mysteries.

So that you may receive the sustenance of the soul from His wisdom,
So that you may devote your soul to the light of His countenance.

That at every breath you may hear His melodies,
That you may drink a cup from His benevolence,

That you may become aware of the mysteries of love,
That you may taste the eternal wine from the rivers of love.

I shall not turn my face from the sword of these wretched ones,
Even if these infidels kill me a hundred times over.

From the beginning, my soul drank your wine,
In remembrance of You, I will give my soul at the end.

Oh Beloved, ignite a new fire,
Burn up the world of inquiry and knowledge.

Purify the soul from the attributes of the world,
Unfold a secret from the hidden mysteries.

Throw a wave from the profound ocean of meaning,
Break the firmament of verbal expression.

Grant me a cup that I may escape myself,
Like a moth, I'll tear apart the veils.

From your bounty, bestow upon existence the Lote Tree,
Reveal the Divine power through your hand.

Oh you, in whose hand lies the fate of the world,
The turning place of the cosmic sphere is from your planning.

Give light to this candle, and from it, give light,
O King of the Moon, to these diverse directions.

This lantern which you have illuminated,
Within the glass of preservation, you have kept it safe.

From the mouth of generosity, you have given it aid,
And from the wick of command, you have given it growth.

So protect it from the wind of oppression,
That your lights may manifest through it.
