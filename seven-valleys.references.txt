+P44-45

That which God---glorified be His Name!---hath desired for Himself is the
hearts of His servants, which are the treasuries of His love and remembrance
and the repositories of His knowledge and wisdom. It hath ever been the wish
of the Eternal King to cleanse the hearts of His servants from the things of
the world and all that pertaineth thereunto, that they may be made worthy
recipients of the effulgent splendours of Him Who is the King of all names and
attributes. Wherefore must no stranger be allowed in the city of the heart,
that the incomparable Friend may enter His abode. By this is meant the
effulgence of His names and attributes, and not His exalted Essence, inasmuch
as that peerless King hath ever been, and shall eternally remain, sanctified
above ascent and descent.
