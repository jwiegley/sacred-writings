\begin{hafez}{HW}{Arabic~\#68, p.~20}
  \lettrine{O}{ Children of Men}! Know ye not why We created you all from the
  same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all
  times in your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from
  one same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk
  with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that
  from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and
  the essence of detachment may be made manifest.
\end{hafez}
